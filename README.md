# 📝 Authenticated Task Management System

## Overview

This beginner-level full stack project introduces students to the core of web application development — **CRUD operations** and **user authentication**. The app will allow users to register, log in, and manage a personal list of tasks in a secure and user-friendly interface.

The objective is to understand how front-end, back-end, and databases interact, and how to implement basic login/session systems that are essential for nearly every application.

---

## 🚀 Goals of the Project

- Understand the full stack workflow: from front-end interaction to database storage.
- Learn user authentication: login, registration, and protected routes.
- Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Practice session/token-based authentication (e.g., JWT, cookies).
- Learn how to structure and modularize code for scalability.

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

> 📌 *The final tech stack will be discussed as a team.*  
Some recommended options:

- Frontend: React.js / HTML-CSS-JS
- Backend: Node.js with Express / Django / Flask
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL
- Authentication: Sessions or JWT
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

---

## 🧱 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup
- Setup GitHub repo & folder structure
- Initialize frontend and backend boilerplate
- Create database schema for users and tasks

### Phase 2: User Authentication
- Implement signup/login/logout routes
- Password encryption (bcrypt or similar)
- Session/token management

### Phase 3: Task CRUD
- Add feature to create, view, edit, and delete tasks
- Connect tasks to logged-in user
- Validate inputs and handle errors

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
- Build UI to show tasks per user
- Login/signup forms with validation
- Connect frontend to backend using API calls

### Phase 5: Polishing & Extras
- UI improvements (dark mode, animations)
- Add filters (completed/incomplete tasks)
- Create responsive layout for mobile/desktop

## 📢 Contribution Guidelines

This guide walks you through how to **fork**, **clone**, **write code**, and **create a Pull Request (PR)** to contribute to the official Nexus Club fullstack project repository.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit the main project repository link shared by the mentor.
2. Click the **"Fork"** button on the top-right corner.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your account.

> 🛠 You’ll now have your own copy where you can push your changes safely.

---

## 💻 Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally

1. Copy the HTTPS clone URL of your fork
   Example:

   ```
   https://github.com/your-username/authenticated-task-management-system.git
   ```
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/authenticated-task-management-system.git
   cd authenticated-task-management-system
   ```

---

## 🌿 Step 3: Create a New Branch

Always create a new branch for every new feature or fix.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

> Example: `feature/login-form` or `bugfix/task-delete-error`

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 4: Make Changes

Now you're free to code!
Modify files, add new ones, or create your project folder as discussed with the team.

✅ Keep your code clean and readable.
✅ Test everything before committing.

---

## 💾 Step 5: Commit Your Changes

Once you're done:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added: login form with validation"
```

---

## 🚀 Step 6: Push Your Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

---

## 📬 Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. You’ll see a banner to create a **Pull Request** — click it.
3. Choose the **base repository** (main club repo) and the branch (`main`) to merge into.
4. Add a **clear title** and **description** of what you’ve done.
5. Click **"Create Pull Request"**.

Wait for the mentor or Fullstack Lead to review your changes and give feedback or approve it for merging.

---

## 🔁 Step 8: Stay Updated with the Main Repo

To avoid conflicts, regularly sync your fork with the main repo.

### Add the main repository as upstream (only once):

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/nexus-club/authenticated-task-management-system.git
```

### Pull the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```

Now continue from Step 3 again if you want to work on a new feature.

---

## 🙌 Final Notes

* Always pull the latest changes before starting work.
* Keep your branches clean and well-named.
* Follow naming conventions and formatting rules.
* Ask me (FullStack Lead) if you're unsure about anything.
